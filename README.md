# SimplifySeq

This repostitory accompanies the following paper published at CP23:
> Bleukx, Ignace, et al. "Simplifying Step-wise Explanation Sequences." 29th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2023). Schloss Dagstuhl-Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik, 2023.

And provides algorithms to generate and post-process step-wise explanations sequences.
An explanation sequence explains a target set of literals by propagating small subsets of constraints. 
Each step in such a sequence takes as input literals derived in previous steps, and the constraints to be propagated.
The output of a step is a new set of literals.


The repository is organised as follows:

```

By creating and post-processing sequences with algorithms in the following order, resulting sequences will satisfy desirable properties such as Atomicity, Sparsity, Pertinence and Non-redundancy. More information about these properties can be found in the paper.

1) Greedy construct
2) Deletion-based filtering
3) Relaxation-based filtering
